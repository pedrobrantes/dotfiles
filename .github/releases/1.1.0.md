### ✨ Features & Improvements

- **Multi-Architecture Support:** Added support for `aarch64` and `x86_64` in `flake.nix` and automatic detection in the `bootstrap` script.
- **Program Modularization:** Dozens of command-line tools were migrated to individual modules in `programs/`, each with its own package and aliases, including:
    - `eza`, `ripgrep`, `fd`, `bat`, `duf`, `doggo`
    - `zoxide`, `htop`, `dust`, `plocate`, `hyperfine`, `iproute2`
- **Testing Infrastructure:** Added a testing framework for the Nix configuration, with tests for:
    - The `bootstrap` script.
    - Bash function logic (`cp_progress`).
    - All new program modules, validating installation and aliases.
- **Bash Config Migration:** Aliases and functions from `.bashrc` were moved into the declarative configuration in `programs/bash.nix`.
- **Bash-it:** Added integration with `bash-it`.

### 📚 Documentation

- **Refactored README:** Installation instructions were completely rewritten, prioritizing the `bootstrap` script.
- **Manual Installation Guide:** The manual guide was simplified, aligned with the use of Flakes, and moved to a separate section.
- **Android Guide:** Added a new section detailing installation on Android via Termux.

### 🐛 Fixes

- Corrected various paths and syntax in the `sops` and `nix` modules.
