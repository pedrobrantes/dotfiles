### 📝 Release Notes v1.3.0

#### 🚀 Testing Infrastructure & Security (Python Migration)
This release introduces a complete overhaul of the testing system, migrating from Shell Script to **Python + Pytest**, delivering improved speed and robustness.

*   **Mandatory Validation:** The `switch.sh` script now automatically runs the test suite before applying any changes. If tests fail, the deployment is aborted.
*   **Test Enforcement:** The system now prevents the build if a new module is added to `programs/` without a corresponding test file (`.py`).
*   **Performance:** The new architecture builds the Nix configuration only once for the entire test session, drastically reducing execution time in CI and locally.
*   **Native CI/CD:** Replaced the Docker-based pipeline with native Nix GitHub Actions (`nix-shell`), aligning the CI environment with local development.

#### ✨ New Features & Tools
New packages have been integrated into the environment:

*   **nh (Nix Helper):** Utility to simplify common Nix commands.
*   **Ollama:** Tool for running LLMs locally.
*   **Magic Wormhole:** Secure and easy file transfer (`wormhole-rs`).
*   **OpenSSH:** SSH client configuration and installation.

#### 🐛 Fixes & Improvements
*   **CI Compatibility:** Added a generic `x86_64.linux.desktop` target to ensure CI (Ubuntu) can validate the build correctly.
*   **fd:** Removed redundant alias that conflicted with the binary name.

#### 🚜 Maintenance
*   Renamed `nix_tests` directory to `tests`.
*   Updated documentation (`README`, `DEVELOPMENT`) to reflect the new Python workflow.
